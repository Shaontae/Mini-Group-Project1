## About The Application ## 
This application grabs user inputs describing their mood in the form of keywords, and then suggests a movie based off the keywords given.

The Application uses Dictionary API to take user inputted words, check if they're real words, and then grab the word and synonyms to use as keywords.

The application then searches TMDB with the given peramaters to fetch and display a movie that best suits the users mood.
